## Team :)

* Jody Sheu
* Christina Wong

## To Do:

### UI Fixes
* On gallery pick screen move the two buttons for "Choose from Gallery" and "Take Photo" to the top of the screen above "Selected Photos" without breaking everything...
* Make the "done" and "next" buttons more consistent at the bottom of the pages (padding and stuff)
* On record page move buttons so "start over" isn't so close to the "record" toggle button

### Things to Make Work (or Fake), Prioritized
* Record a fake video and put it on the preview page
* Dragging to reorder after selecting photos
* Some indication of recording on the record page
* Carry over camera photo to other pages

### Video
* Record a 2 min screencast going through pages, faking as necessary

### Writeup
* Take screenshots of all the android app pages
* * Explain design decisions on each page, maybe compare to mocks
* Write up which things were faked and why
